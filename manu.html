<h3>My Opinion</h3>
<p>What a proud moment for 140 crore Indians! I was always rooting for Manu Bhaker to win big in this year's Olympics. What happened last time in Tokyo was very unfortunate when her pistol malfunctioned. She was almost about to quit shooting after that but thankfully, she didn't give up! She put in a lot of effort, came back stronger and the result is now in front of everyone and cherished by all! What a comeback.</p>
